0:11 type the six titles of the lessons that we're going to cover this weekend one
0:16 tonight is entitled in its inspiring vision for your marriage okay uh
0:23 tomorrow we'll cover some other titles that you've already seen uh and then we'll finish up on Sunday morning so
0:29 we've got one tonight for tomorrow and then the party of course uh and then on Sunday morning we will
0:37 finish the sixth so an inspiring vision for your marriage
0:43 Among Us we have people who are uh newly married and thrilled
0:52 with it and among us we have people who have
0:58 been uh been married for many years and are still just loving it
1:04 and for others of us we uh we've had bumps along the way
1:10 their highs and their lows and it's okay because that's completely
1:15 normal what's important is that we are faithful and trusting and persevering to the end
What are we going to learn?
1:23 um but what are we going to learn tonight we're going to learn four truths from the scriptures
1:29 now there are many other truths in the scriptures even the scriptures we're going to cover there are many many
1:34 truths but I just want to highlight these four truths that we're going to gather from
1:40 the scriptures uh number one is that marriage is good amen and those those
1:48 who have experienced bumps difficult times in our marriage years
1:54 uh we may begin to doubt that okay but uh this is a time to renew our
2:03 uh our optimism our faith our vision now is the time to say
2:11 God has said marriage is good uh I am going to do everything I can to
2:17 allow God to realize that in my life now truth number two is in marriage God has
2:25 made the two of us one so married life is learning to live as
2:30 one so the the title for the the weekend is learning to live as well
2:36 we're going to learn that our relationship with marriage is like God's relationship with his people
2:42 and finally we're going to learn that true love is selfless and sacrificial now none of these things are new to you
2:50 okay but it's hard to find a scripture which is completely brand new
2:56 but we're going to cover these things so that everybody is is capable of the
3:02 final outcome okay I make an observation that marriage is a blessing and an
3:07 opportunity regardless of the challenges but the out the desired outcome for
3:13 tonight is that every one of us every one of us here and every one of us
3:19 who hears a recording of this in the future and it will be on YouTube
3:25 in due course um that every one of us is both dedicated to and making art dedicated to
3:34 making our marriage great and hopeful that it will be that hopeful that our marriage will be
3:42 great not today and tomorrow but to the end until Death Shall part us
3:49 I I have let me just apologize that I have broken most of the rules of
3:55 creating uh presentations by putting way too much information on the slides but
4:00 that's okay okay it's just a quirky thing about me and just work with me
4:05 okay uh nonetheless uh it's important when doing a marriage class to be able
What is Authoritative on Marriage?
4:12 to separate the scriptural from the cultural and indeed from that which is merely opinion and advice okay so our
4:21 focus is going to be on what are the scriptural truths okay and you can adapt to your culture
4:29 uh I mean you want to stick with the scriptures and then there will be some cultural things that that make up your
4:35 marriage so if we say something that seems culturally different don't worry about that if somebody's clearly opinion
4:41 or advice weigh it think about it but ultimately it's the scriptural things
4:47 that will help you get to have you and your your spouse get to heaven everyone
4:52 is different so if we give opinions they may work for some they may not work for
4:58 others but uh but you be the uh you be the responsible for uh for saying wow
5:06 I'm going to study that out I'm going to have a quiet time on that I am going to memorize some of those scriptures and I
5:13 am going to let the word of God change my life and my marriage now what does the Bible say about
5:19 marriage and by the way there's a lot more information on the slides than I'm going to cover in uh in my focused time here tonight
What Does the Bible Say About Marriage?
5:30 um first of all the Bible describes many many things about relationships between
5:36 people any people between you and your brother you and your sister between you
5:41 and someone who is not in the church there are things by the way everyone is going to receive this uh this
5:48 presentation in full as long as you're on the uh the married WhatsApp so um you'll you'll you'll be able to
5:56 have the whole thing um in order to study but first of all the Bible says many things about
6:02 relationships between all people secondly it deals with uh the special
6:08 aspects of the relationship of marriage okay so just to be aware of that the Bible is actually
6:14 has a very limited amount specifically about marriage but it has an enormous amount about
6:22 being good to another person and and so it it actually has a lot to
6:29 say about marriage I'm not going to go into all these words which I've uh which
6:34 I've plucked out but you get the idea um if you look for every every one another passage in the Bible in the New
6:42 Testament you'll see all the words on the right and these are just every
6:47 disciple is to do this with every other person right love one another encourage one another instruction another teach
6:53 one another admonish one another build one another out Etc um in marriage we have some different
6:58 words uh but they all work together okay so let's dig into some scriptures here
7:04 and by the way the way that we're going to do this I know you would rather hear Susan than me okay the way we're gonna
7:10 do this is that I'm gonna move through this and she will have something to add
7:15 partic in certain places okay she's here this keeps me honest you know I'm talking about a real relationship right
7:23 um okay Genesis 1 verses 27 to 31. so God created Mankind in his own image
The Book of Genesis
7:31 in the image of God he created the male and female he created them God blessed
7:36 them and said to them be fruitful and increase in number I like that fill the
7:42 Earth and subdue it okay that's a little bit more challenging but we're gonna go with that too
7:47 and then in verse 31 God saw all that he had made and it was
7:52 good no it was very good if you uh if you look through the six
8:00 days of creation you say at the end of the first five days what does God say he says touch God
8:07 it was good but at the end of the sixth day of creation when he had made man and woman
8:13 in fact the way Jesus describes it the first husband and wife even though they didn't have a wedding
8:19 ceremony Jesus considers them Adam and Eve husband and wife and he said it is very good
8:26 so here we have in right at the beginning um God says marriage is very good and
8:34 furthermore the Lord God said in Genesis 2 18 to 25 the Lord God said it is not
8:39 good for the man to be alone I will make
8:46 a helper suitable for him but for Adam no suitable helper was
8:51 found then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man and he brought her to the man
8:58 the man said this is now bone of my bones Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman
9:04 for she was taken out of man that is why a man leaves his father and mother and is United to his wife and
9:10 they become one flesh Adam and his wife were both naked and they felt no shame now we'll cover some
9:18 of these points uh later on in the lessons but uh this is a rich passage
9:23 about marriage I just want to touch on the fact that here in Genesis 2 the
9:29 beginning of the scriptures uh written by Moses the Books of Moses here verse
9:34 24 that is why a man leaves his father and mother and is United to his wife and they become one flesh now this verse is
9:42 actually referred to by Jesus okay when he sees you and it's referred
9:47 to by Paul multiple times when he's teaching so this is a pretty important passage right here
9:52 and this notion of one flesh it applies both to the relationship that
10:00 that enact in fact God has made the two into one in terms of their relationship
10:06 such that he does not want married couples to break apart he does not want them to divorce so this
10:14 one flesh Works in terms of it one body that they made one unit out of two okay
10:22 it's the relationship it's an unbreakable relationship it is permanently and completely fused
10:30 okay fused together it also is is used to describe the sexual Union
10:36 and Paul in different places uses it to describe the sexual Union but it means
10:43 both these things as made clear by both Jesus and Paul so um so this is the this is the uh
10:53 the foundation for the title for the weekend
10:58 okay learning to live as one God has made the two of us one and
The Book of Matthew
11:06 therefore we've got to live working that out we've got to figure out how do we behave
11:12 this one how do we communicate so that we think guess what how do we be sensitive so that we feel as well how do
11:19 we be a team so that we operate as one right this is the challenge of the
11:28 married life okay here Jesus refers back to the
11:33 Genesis chapter 2 passage some Pharisees came to him to test them they asked is
11:39 it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason in Matthew 19 verses three to six haven't you read he
11:47 replied that at the beginning the Creator made them male and female
11:52 and said for this reason a man would leave his father and mother and be United to his wife and the two will
11:58 become one flesh so they are no longer two but one flesh
12:05 therefore what God has joined together let no one separate
12:10 okay is this cultural no is this human opinion
12:17 no this is scripture this is what God had
12:22 in mind when he created mankind that he would take two pairs and he
12:28 would put them together and he would make one and Jesus uses this quote from
12:34 Genesis 2 to demonstrate that you shouldn't be divorcing no you
12:40 shouldn't divorce for any and every reason that's ridiculous um in fact what God has joined together
12:46 it is his will that no one's suffered okay in Ephesians chapter 5 Paul comes
The Book of Ephesians
12:54 back and does the same thing he refers to this passage in the same way Ephesians chapter 5
12:59 verses 28 to 33 in the same way husbands ought to love their wives as their own
13:05 bodies he who loves his wife loves himself after all no one ever hated their own
13:12 body but they feed and care for their body just as Christ does the church
13:18 for we are members of his body for this reason a man will leave his father and mother be United to his wife and the two
13:24 will become one flesh this is a profound mystery but I am talking about Christ
13:30 and the church however each one of you must also love
13:36 his wife as he loves himself and the wife must respect your husband so there are two really important things
13:43 first of all Paul also uh Echoes this teaching that uh that you should operate
13:51 like one body okay the two of you should function as a
13:56 unit as a team as partners as one body you should care for each other as one
14:03 body uh because of that passage about God making the two into one
14:10 okay and that brings us to some conclusions students you decide whether
14:16 these conclusions are Justified from the scriptures we've covered that Christian marriage is really all
Christian Marriage = Learning to Live as One
14:23 about burning to live as one right we are one that's a spiritual fact
14:29 God made us that at marriage when we took the Covenant the marriage vowed
14:35 so Christian marriage is really all about learning how to live that way
14:40 in fact God has made two people husband and wife into one married life is learning to live as one so here's some
14:47 conclusions as well your spouse is the most important person in the
14:54 world for you the most important and if you say well my mother's pretty
15:03 important okay it's true she's important but did
15:08 God make you and she won never again to be dissolved not except
15:14 by death no what about your colleagues you're caught the people you're in
15:20 business with they're very important are they not but they are not as important
15:27 as your spouse your spouse is the most important person in your life until death do your part
15:36 now here's another statement that your marriage is the most important
15:42 project that you will ever undertake in your entire life
15:48 inches okay now you've got a career am I right you even got children to race
15:56 but you know what children get married leave their father and mother and
16:01 they're United to their spouses the person who's in your life until
16:07 death do you part is your wonderful lovely or alternately handsome uh spouse
16:17 so make it fun and successful because it's the most important thing that you
16:23 will do in your life that doesn't mean that if it has
16:29 failed somehow that your life missile there are plenty more important things to do and it
16:35 doesn't mean that people who are not married don't have meaningful lives they do got it God has a rich wealth of
16:42 things that are meaningful to do in life but for those who are married
16:48 these statements remain true your spouse is the most important person in the world to you and your marriage is
16:56 the most important project you will ever undertake so don't ever give up trying and growing
17:06 the currents of territory here I do want to to cover over what is love
What is Love? (Agape)
17:12 most of us would agree that a central aspect of marriage it's love is it not
17:19 okay we're commanded husbands love your wives uh I mean there's and oh by the way
17:26 although there's not a specific instruction to wife for wives
17:31 to love their husbands uh there are plenty of commands about loving one another okay obviously love is critical
17:38 in marriage a love is critical in every relationship it's the foundation of every relationship
17:44 so uh so what is love we all know that love is not a few and am I right and we
17:49 all have been exposed I imagine to the three Greek words for love right Agape
17:54 which means the self a sacrificial kind of love and phileo which is the
18:00 Friendship the Brotherly Love okay and uh Eros which is the romantic or erotic
18:07 love okay the sexual love so agape love is what is what Jesus typified when it
18:13 says God so loved the world it's it's when when we talk about Jesus
18:19 loving us we're talking about the Agave kind of love the self-sacrificial kind
18:24 of love so uh we all know that the greatest of all passages on love in First
18:31 Corinthians 13 verses 4 through 7. let's just look at it quickly love is patient love is kind it does not
18:39 envy it does not boast it is not proud it does not dishonor others it is not self-seeking
18:47 come back to that it's not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs love does not Delight
18:54 in evil but rejoices with the truth it always protects always trusts always
19:01 hopes always perseveres you'd think that this was a marriage scripture it's so
19:07 jam-packed with great marriage lessons but it's not this is a scripture which applies to all
19:14 people to us loving all our brothers and sisters
19:20 including ourselves right right okay so First Corinthians 13 the
19:25 great love passage and uh you know in support of this notion that love is
19:31 actually a sacrificial thing uh it is a self um
19:36 but it is it is giving oneself up for your spouse right here here it says love
19:42 is not self-seeking does that describe your marriage
19:48 no I'm not I don't seek myself in my marriage does that describe your marriage
19:56 and then these last four always's are just amazing
20:01 and you would do well to memorize the whole Passage okay uh but uh if if nothing else just
20:09 verse seven La it always protects
20:15 does that describe your marriage that you are protective
20:20 of your husband or wife that it always trusts
20:25 does that describe your marriage that you always trust your husband or wife
20:33 uh and and oh by the way God trusted us some when we were untrustworthy
20:39 and in many ways we are untrustworthy before the Lord and he continues to entrust things to us
20:46 like the ministry of reconciliation which has been entrusted to us even though we fall so far short so many
20:53 times so trust is not something which has to be earned I mean it it's best if it's earned okay
21:01 but love extends Trust even when it has not been Earth
21:07 okay love always trusts always hopes is that does that distract your marriage
21:14 that I always am hopeful of our marriage I'm always hopeful for my husband or my
21:20 wife uh always perseveres never gives up okay and you know what there are many
21:29 ways that we give up on Marriage that is not
21:35 abandonment there are all kinds of little emotional
21:41 withdrawals that we go through things we're retired or dealing with
21:47 this situation with her husband or wife and we withdraw
21:53 that we stop persevering that we settle for less
22:00 okay now there are challenges to be sure but love always perseveres
22:08 does that describe your marriage uh does it describe you with regard to your
22:14 marriage it always perseveres in Ephesians 5 verse 25 it's and this is
22:22 a reminder we already covered this husbands love your wives just as Christ loved the church and
22:28 gave himself up for so love is
22:34 about about giving yourself up for one another does that describe your marriage
22:41 right I I do this right that that that's the spirit I do this all the time you
22:47 know in in our marriage I am constantly thinking of
22:53 well I can do the hard part and make it easier for Susan
22:58 I can defer to her wishes and I can adapt and lift her up I can do this
23:07 I've done that for the children uh but I it started with my relationship with my
23:12 wife right uh to husbands as you love your wives it's to give yourself up for
23:19 her like Jesus gave himself up for the church in Romans chapter 12 it talks
23:24 about love it's not a marriage scripture but it's talking about love and he says honor one another above yourselves
23:32 does that describe you in your marriage that you honor
23:38 your wife wives that you honor your husbands above
23:43 yourselves is that your marriage Philippians
23:50 chapter 2 verses three and four it talks about the attitude of Christ Jesus here
23:55 and it doesn't specifically say it's love but it says do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceived
24:02 rather in humility value others above yourselves
24:10 not looking to your own interests what not looking to your own interests
24:18 but each of you to the interests of the others wow does that describe our marriages
24:26 that we value the other above even ourselves
24:33 okay that's not provoking and that we don't look out for our own interests
24:39 but we look out for the interests of our spouse
24:44 okay so what have we learned there's been the the the scripture heavy segment of the of the uh evening what
What have WE learned so far? (Truths)
24:53 have we learned we've learned that marriage is good it was intended to be good it's good in the mind of God if it's not good in your
25:00 mind then it's not God's fault I mean God wants you to be experiencing that
25:05 which is very good in marriage God made the two of us one so married life is learning to live as
25:12 one our relationship in marriage is like God's relationship with his people remember how uh Paul said I I'm talking
25:20 about Christ in his church it's a Divine mystery um when he was talking about marriage
25:27 and uh true love is selfless and sacrificial so what does this look like practically
25:34 speaking okay those are all good Steve you know you've done a good job reading the
25:40 verses to us and certainly driving them home but what does that mean because there's so many details in
25:47 marriage what about washing the dishes where's that
25:52 right what about picking the kids up from school okay so what is Christian marriage okay
25:59 so this is um this is our view of Christian marriage right because there's so many moving
Our View of Christian Marriage (Chart 1)
26:06 parts right it's hard to keep them all in your brain at one time so for me I
26:11 like a good simple diagram okay and those of us who learn better by pictures
26:17 will also be grateful for this diagram this diagram will recur throughout the
26:24 the lessons Okay in fact the three layers of this uh this marriage pyramid
26:30 will be the next three lessons Okay growing as friends growing as partners
26:36 growing as lovers and this is the mental model that we have in our minds this is
26:43 the way we have of organizing all those tricky things that are important to work
26:49 out in marriage that first and foremost there's a foundation of being great friends
26:59 now sometimes people get in their minds husband leader wife helper
27:07 husband leader wife submit yeah the husband has to love and they're confused
27:14 a little bit by that truth and they forget the the basic principle that the reason
27:22 you fell in love with each other was because you were great friends
27:28 and what's going to keep you with a smile on your face throughout your
27:34 journey till death do you part is the friendship that you have
27:41 and we have Council people who they say all their issues are about the children
27:48 or about the work or about the nagging about the housework or or whatever and it's and we we start exploring with them
27:54 tell us about your friendship and they've completely lost it
28:01 that their friendship is no more their lives as married couple is all
28:07 about the tasks and the duties and all the disagreements
28:13 they have with about that and they've lost the Friendship so you can be great Partners but I want to put
28:20 to you that being great friends is the foundation and I I put some words up
28:26 here Selfless Love security that is one of the greatest blessings of
28:34 marriage is having security and self-esteem
28:39 that you're that there's always going to be someone to be with you in the evening
28:46 as you wind down from the day always someone you're going to be able to lay your head on the pillow next to always
28:53 someone that you're going to wake up and you're going to be able to take care of when they're sick and they'll take care
28:58 of you when you're I mean that that security is and the companionship is
29:03 such those are such wonderful aspects of marriage but esteem is a huge one okay
29:10 or or security and by that I didn't mean Financial Security I mean emotional
29:15 security I mean that your spouse thinks you are just absolutely wonderful
29:24 absolutely wonderful that in fact you are the perfect
29:31 spouse for them the perfect spouse for them now you
29:38 notice I didn't say the perfect spouse yeah you're the perfect spouse for that God
29:44 made you one you are the perfect spouse for one
29:49 another amen so there there are lots of great words here on this Foundation about being great friends a common
29:57 Outlook is also important do you know your the natural friends that you made friendships you made when you were uh I
30:04 mean even before you're a Christian um they were common interests right
30:09 well it's it's not so much that you know Susan really loves football or that or
30:18 the computers or that she's good with computers or but but there are certain things that we we share a common Outlook
30:25 and in fact the most important things well the most important things are all the rest right we are Disciples of Jesus
30:33 and uh everything that we have is God's and every decision is how to best obey
30:39 God and how to best deploy his assets in his service so this is our common
30:46 Outlook and because we have this common Outlook it makes the Friendship work
30:51 I mean so when yet another person needs a place to stay and it's inconvenient
30:57 and we make we make the the guest room available because that's being
31:03 hospitable is a God thing so having a common Outlook is a huge thing about
31:09 being friends and it's a a huge thing about being about really having a great
31:15 foundation for marriage being great Partners there are many topics in here
31:20 and in fact this is what a lot of marriage issues are over is
31:25 disagreements about all these details that it's challenging to be great
31:31 Partners on all these things and just right there are Ministry issues what God
31:38 wants is you to be a great Partners in the ministry what God wants is you to be great Partners in your household work so
31:45 that all the jobs that need to get done get done and uh and there is Joy right
31:51 that the finances get done or that if they don't get done at least you're unified about how
31:58 they're not getting done okay I mean there are challenges in life but being unified being great Partners uh there's
32:06 there's raising the children which is the second greatest project that God has given us on this Earth
32:13 um but uh then there's our careers in future uh life and family plans extended
32:18 family right her family his family these things are all kinds of things that
32:24 we need to work on being great partners okay so that's not news to anybody what
32:31 what may be uh helpful though is this is organizing it in this sort of way Susan
How to be a Great Partner
32:36 would you like to comment with at the beginning you know the overall class is learning to live is
32:42 what and this is these are areas that we've had to grow with things still come
32:47 up you know like with extended family all of a sudden you have an aging parent that you hell never faced that before so
32:55 you have to learn to live as one and caring for that that thing so this this
33:01 whole thing about great Partners is all of these things keep coming up maybe for
33:08 some reason you move into a new house and then all of a sudden the household doesn't run smoothly anymore or you know
33:14 the children move out then things are different but it's it's always this growth and this learning to live as one
33:21 in these areas [Music]
How God Views Christian Marriage (Chart 2)
33:26 uh we could have drawn the diagram this way so this is implicit
33:32 okay that being great disciples together is really in the foundation
33:37 it's what gives us our common Outlook so uh in terms of being great having a
33:43 great marriage or growing in marriage or learning to live as one uh this is implicit so I I've got the the diagram
33:51 of the top three layers uh in order to deal with marriage related stuff marriage specific stuff but it's
33:58 understood whenever I show you the diagram with the three layers there's being great disciples together is
34:05 implied okay now marriage is best when both husband
Marriage is best when both belong to the Lord
34:12 and wife belong to the Lord okay so that was the the point of this
34:19 part of the diagram is that being great disciples together is is so beneficial and I've got a
34:27 couple of Concepts to uh to communicate here about that so first of all First Corinthians 7 verse 39 Paul's talking
34:35 about a woman with a non-Christian husband and what to do in that circumstance and
34:41 uh and then he gets to a point where he says well a woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives but if her
34:47 husband dies she is free to marry anyone she wishes and he didn't stop there did he
34:53 no no he is she's free to marry anyone she wishes but he must belong to the
34:59 Lord because where's your foundation
35:04 where's that Foundation if you don't belong to the Lord okay
35:09 secondly in another verse do not be yoked together with unbelievers and it's not clear by the way that this passage
35:16 is specifically talking about marriage okay it's a general principle but it certainly applies to marriage do not be
35:24 yoked together with unbelievers for what your righteousness and wickedness have in common what Fellowship can light have with
35:30 Darkness Paul is pre uh dramatic about about
35:37 being in a yoked relationship with an unbeliever now
35:43 he's he's described in First Corinthians 7. it can work it can work if your great wife you have
35:49 a non-believing husband it can work okay you don't have all the advantages
35:55 but but don't choose to go into that if you can help it okay uh don't choose to
36:01 go into that situation now let's talk a little bit more about the foundation I'm developing this concept okay in a
What is the Foundation of YOUR Marriage?
36:08 Christian marriage you have your foundation on God that is you have unchanging shared priorities let's just
36:16 rattle off a few of them uh we have given up everything to follow Jesus we deny ourselves daily
36:23 isn't that a isn't that a I mean that's an amazing commonality you have because
36:29 you're disciples we love unconditionally because you first loved us we love each
36:35 other we love others unconditionally because you first loved us that is a great thing that Susan and I have in
36:41 common we are growing together and reaching out to love others together
36:47 uh we submit out of reverence for Christ that's an awesome thing if if my wife
36:53 didn't have a reference for Christ we wouldn't both be doing that um and uh we forgive as he forgave us
37:01 our self-esteem joy and contentment come from God even in hardship and that's
37:07 going to uh to help us and uh in demonstration on the next couple of slides but now let's talk about
37:14 non-Christian marriage non-Christian marriages don't have this same shared Foundation
37:20 okay um they do they can have some Foundation but the this Foundation is merely
37:27 compatible self-interest okay any sh and any shared priorities
37:33 are prone to shift through life have you noticed how you're a different person than you
37:40 were 20 years ago I mean and I'm I'm talking about independent of your your arcs in Christ
37:48 I mean the situations of your life have made have put you through
37:53 Temptations and hardships and difficulties that have made you a different person
38:00 than you were when you first got married and uh and if that's the case
38:07 your priorities are going to shift if they're not rooted in the word of God
38:14 and you may think oh those two people who are not CR who are not Christians
38:20 they've got a lot in common well that that's great I wish them the best really I want everyone who gets
38:27 married Christian or non-Christian to have a happy married life together I really do I'm just saying
38:33 that there is a weakness and we have all seen
38:39 it in friends or colleagues uh outside the church and sometimes
38:45 sadly Within that uh that they're they're not founded they're not uh
38:52 rooted on these common foundations that keep them together uh they they end up
38:58 uh dueling over self-interest and those self-interests have uh have uh separated
39:04 have gone moved apart so let's talk about how can another way
Non-Christian Marriage (Conditional Love)
39:10 another reason why Christian marriages are so much stronger and and able to be
39:17 stronger than non-Christian marriages non-Christian marriages are governed by
39:23 this principle who is giving more to the other me or my spouse
39:29 and this is what usually happens every person thinks in their mind well I'm given the majority
39:36 in this relationship I'm given probably 75 percent I just threw that number out
39:42 there okay I'm giving the majority in this in this marriage uh and and you see what they're what
39:49 they're getting from their spouse is 45 percent so like they're not even pulling their
39:55 weight I'm giving the majority but what's happening they're both doing that in
40:01 their mind they both think I do I've given more than she is I'm given more than he is
40:06 okay so they end up giving slightly less than half and
40:13 there is difficulty and hardship an emotional hurt
40:18 that that sets in right if this is your operating principle then you do not have
40:26 the capacity to give a hundred percent but Christians operate according to a
Christian Marriage (Unconditional Love)
40:32 different principle God loves me in abundance and if God loves me in abundance more
40:39 than I can even imagine then I can love my spouse on commission
40:45 so God has given me a hundred percent even though I don't deserve it I can
40:50 turn around and give 100. because I am filled with gratitude
40:57 so it's not about okay well I gotta I'm gonna do my half of the chores if you do
41:02 your half you better do all your half because if you don't do your half yeah I'm not gonna do my ass and I'm gonna be
41:09 grumpy about the fact that you didn't do your half and I'm gonna now you about the half you didn't do
41:16 come on okay we have far view from us to do that
In Christ, Marriage is...
41:22 thoughts from Stephen and Susan I would like you to take this one away okay so just to sum this up and uh go to
41:32 recap what he said just you know in Christ a marriage is a best friend to go
41:38 through life with someone that you can count on that can be there for you you know they'll they'll see you through the
41:46 hard things and celebrate the joys with you it's a safe Foundation to raise a
41:52 family on it really can when this when your marriage is good and stable that
42:00 gives so much security to the children and it just does wonders for them and
42:06 then it's someone to grow old with I mean that a beautiful thing to have
42:11 someone by your side in a marriage there are opportunities to grow spiritually as we grow closer to each other as friends
42:19 partners and lovers and thereby closer to God and then tomorrow we're going to
42:25 go through each one of those things we're going to Bear down a little more in detail with those there are things
42:32 that you will never learn until you're married and they will never things you
42:37 will never learn unless you persevere in your marriage so those that's sort of a summary
42:46 now by the way uh these we say these to each other all the time
42:56 so I I'll look at Susan and say it's so great Bruno
43:02 yeah especially if I'm complaining about about gray hair or losing muscle strength or something like that is like
43:09 I'm fighting with my punch you know you know the dunlop's disease where my
43:16 belly's done lopped over my belt um so the fact is that we're getting
43:21 older and there are complications to our relationship because there are
43:28 complications to our health yeah but you know what right we're there for each other and we love growing all together
43:35 it's a safe Foundation to raise a family and that's just a principle that why
43:40 um you know God wants people to hold off sex until marriage
43:46 because sex before marriage produces children before marriage and children before marriage are not safe
43:53 that is not a safe environment to raise a family um so
44:00 um what we've got here the these are this is homework for you
Marriage Homework 1 (Self-Reflection)
44:06 now we realize that uh you know this is uh an evening Friday
44:13 evening of a marriage retreat and you may want to you know get back to
44:18 the hotel room and spend some romantic time with your with your husband or wife
44:24 um so this is not homework you have to complete before the remaining activities of the evening
44:30 okay um but this is homework that I want to uh encourage you to do
44:39 um and what we what have we've given you on all the classes all the first four anyway are
44:45 um self reflection questions okay to think deeply about yourself
44:52 okay these are not I mean you could discuss them with your spouse but the important thing is you spend time
44:58 thinking about these uh for yourself each one of you think about the self-reflection questions
45:05 um by the way uh if if we had a question and answer session
45:11 which we will momentarily how many people have questions
45:16 that you would like to ask okay uh you know once it gets rolling people
45:23 start thinking about it but since they're not 10 hands that have gone up
45:28 um I'm gonna see a little bit more time from the question and answer session okay if you think of something you know
45:34 wave your hand and then I'll I'll wrap it up and we'll get to the question and answer session okay we have one back
45:40 there okay uh so so here's just some important uh self-reflection questions
45:47 um and and you'll recognize well you know what I'm not going to read through them uh please reflect on those what I
45:54 do want to do is talk about this okay this is guidance on how to have a
Marriage Homework 2 (Communicating with Your Spouse)
45:59 good discussion with your spouse all right so
46:06 don't complain about one another if you're going to have a productive
46:13 discussion with your spouse it needs to be positive
46:19 and if if you are complaining by the way you're violating the scripture which says do everything without a complain if
46:25 you ever complain about your spouse you should never be complained okay don't
46:31 complain don't blame don't cut down don't accuse don't say
46:36 always or never here's an example you always disrespect me
46:41 is that true no no one always does something bad or
46:48 never does something good but we always say that don't we
46:54 okay I just did the thing that you shouldn't do She's Always a no actually
47:01 you can use always and never they're emotional words and especially if you're if you're talking to someone and you're
47:08 you're a venting okay you really just got to get all this stuff off your chest
47:14 which shouldn't be about your spouse to your spouse okay but if you're venting to your if if I if I'm struggling with
47:21 someone Susan I'm talking to my brother who understands me I if I use always or never he
47:29 understands and I understand that's not really true I'm just venting okay those are emotional words
47:35 those are emotional words I need to come back Circle back around and correct myself and say now she doesn't always do
47:42 that I so anyway be ready to apologize that's super important you know the uh
47:51 to the humility yeah when when we get in a fight we've gotta we've got a a short uh rip
48:00 chord okay so that where the parachute comes out uh she cries and I apologize
48:07 okay and by the way we haven't had to use that rip cord in years years
48:15 it's been years Okay so our fights are pretty General okay
48:21 um we try not to have fights we really do but uh that's taken you know it takes
48:27 time okay build up and encourage give the benefit of the doubt super important it's not about who's right and who's
48:33 wrong um it's about how can we move forward together so this is a skill that I want
48:41 you to remember okay this is a skill a technique that is really important to
48:46 remember learn to do this Susan when you do black
48:54 it makes me feel blank okay or Susan you know what when you do
49:01 that it makes me feel so great right you see those can be used as
49:06 negative in the negative or in the positive but you know what I'm not doing I'm not
49:12 accusing or blaming I'm saying this is a shared problem right
49:17 when you so I have an example down here instead of you always disrespect me is
49:24 it when you say things like that it discourages me and you know why this technique works
49:31 okay am I an expert on what's going on inside
49:37 her heart no so if I blame her or if I start start uh
49:44 accusing her of things she didn't do that probably says more about me and my
49:51 insecurities than about really what's going on in her heart I I don't know what's going on in her heart but what I
49:57 can do is point out what she did and how it makes me feel
50:03 okay in the positive or in the negative because there's nothing that makes a wife feel more secure when you share
50:10 your feelings like that and she knows oh and then I I have motivation if he says
50:17 that makes me feel insecure or that gives me motivation to change that
50:25 so learn that skill right how to say when you do this it makes me feel bad
50:32 because you know what you are an expert I am an expert on my feelings I'm much
50:37 more an expert on my feelings than she is so I can say when you do that it hurts me
50:46 no I'm not I can't say you hurt me okay because she really hurt me I mean
50:53 it's it could be all kinds of things I don't believe correctly or or misunderstandings I have I mean the fact
51:00 that I'm feeling that way is not her fault necessarily but if she understands that when she
51:07 does this it makes me feel that does anyone in here have difficulty
51:13 driving with your spouse that their backseat driving they're trying to correct you on how you drive does anyone
51:19 have that problem okay a few a few yeah okay that that has
51:24 been that has been the central fight of our married life
51:30 okay 29 years and it's a very gentle fight yeah okay uh very gentle fight but
51:37 but the most consistent point of con of conflict is my driving
51:43 okay and here's what here's what happens when I'm driving by myself I get from point A to point B I don't
51:50 have any accidents okay and and I I have a pretty good record
51:55 but when I'm getting when I'm driving and she's in the car I'm talking I'm
52:00 sharing my life I'm talking about things I'm interested in I lose track of where
52:06 I'm supposed to turn and and you know she's holding on to the the
52:12 little hand handlebar holding under the seat and and we've learned
52:18 to say um well we've learned to to use this kind
52:24 of language you know when you when you tell me where to turn
52:32 before we even get there it makes me feel like you don't think
52:37 I'm going to do the right thing and what I really hope is that you would believe in me that I'll do the right
52:44 thing so the fact is so so then we work on that we said well the fact is I often do
52:52 the wrong thing okay I just don't want her to assume that I'm going to do the wrong thing
52:57 so we worked out a way to talk about it so what I gave her was I gave her a way
53:03 to say something so that I could understand it and accept it so I said
53:08 here's what you should do you should say um um hey do you have your barracks
53:16 I mean do you know where you're going do you know where you're going and are you are you situated because I have
53:22 confessed many times that oh I don't know where I'm going uh because I've been busy talking to her okay and she
53:29 says so do you do you have your bearings and that allows me to say yes
53:34 and if it's the case then I say yeah thank you and because she expressed that
53:41 positively right I mean I know you have your parents right right um so I could take that and then I say
53:48 uh but but actually many times it's like oh oh no uh where are we oh my turn is
53:56 right up there thank you honey and it was a success a successful
54:01 communication instead of a conflict so uh with that here are a number of
Marriage Homework 3 (Discussion with Your Spouse)
54:08 um discussion questions um for you just to uh to to discuss
54:15 between you and down at the bottom I just want to point out well throughout their reminders to use the when you do
54:22 this it makes me feel that sort of language but at the bottom
54:28 there's a question that says uh who are the three couples we want to be close to
54:34 who can give us who can help us as we grow in our marriage now three is not a scriptural number I
54:41 mean for this it's just it would be good to have more than one and by certainly it's good to have one
54:48 and it's good to it's better to have more than one so everyone should have a couple of
54:54 people who will really know them okay and generally speaking those would
55:01 be in your Bible talk or in your family group or what your small group okay maybe they're they're somewhere at
55:09 large in the uh in the community or sector that you're in but if if all your
55:15 friends who know you are in another country or in another city or in another
55:21 sector that's not a really great um situation it's okay to have a great
55:27 friend in another country who really knows you from some time ago but it's great to have people who are close to
55:34 you who you're in Ministry with who with whom well who can help you in
55:40 marriage when you need it when you need to make a call and the second to last bullet is what I want to end with
55:48 um hopefully you're able to let me just say this would be a great thing to say to each other tonight just try it on
55:55 maybe it doesn't work for you but try this I love you
56:00 amen I love you you are the perfect spouse for me
56:06 I'm the Brewing spouser so with that
56:12 we conclude our lesson portion
